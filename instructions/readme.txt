This assignment is meant to build your confidence and knowledge when it comes to navigating and implementing API’s. In order to bring in cool or desired features and data from other sources into your project, this is an important thing to practice. That being said, time for some celestial fact finding. Using the NASA open API, which can be found here:

https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#getting-started

Read through the documentation. Create a web page that tells me what potentially hazardous asteroids were tracked over the last week: (dates exactly 7 days apart)
If you don't find many potentially hazardous asteroids over the last week, try looking at a different week that has multiple potentially dangerous asteroids.

Build a section on this page for each asteroid. This section should include its velocity in MPH, it’s maximum diameter in feet, and it’s distance from earth. Bonus points if you somehow use this data to rank, color code, or otherwise display these on a scale from most to least dangerous sounding. This can simply be based on your intuition regarding very big rocks flying at earth and what you’d be more scared of.

Hey cohort, in regards to the NASA assignment: I've decided to award full credit if you can show me the dangerous asteroids for a SINGLE date, rather than needing to do so for EVERY day of 7 day week. Bonus points if you can show me all the dangerous asteroids for a whole week.
